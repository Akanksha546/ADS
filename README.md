Autonomous Driving Simulation: Simulate an autonomous vehicle learning to navigate a virtual environment while obeying traffic rules.

Abstract
This report presents a basic autonomous driving simula<on implemented using Python's Pygame library. The simulation focuses on a four-way intersection with traffic lights, cars, and simple traffic rules. The core functionalities include:
• Environment Creation: Defining the road layout, sidewalks, dividers, and traffic lights.
• Car Dynamics: Spawning, moving, and removing cars based on traffic light signals and lane
rules.
• Traffic Light Control: Implementing a basic traffic light cycle to control the flow of traffic.
• While this simulation provides a foundational understanding of autonomous driving concepts, it lacks advanced features like realtime sensor data processing, path planning, and collision avoidance.
Our approach provides a lightweight yet extensible plaWorm for testing autonomous vehicle behaviors in controlled urban environments. The results indicate that rule-based traffic management systems can effec<vely coordinate multiple vehicles through complex intersec<ons while maintaining traffic flow and safety parameters.

Introduction
Urban traffic management systems are becoming increasingly complex with the introduc<on of autonomous vehicles (AVs) into existing infrastructure. Simulation environments play a crucial role in tes<ng and valida<ng autonomous vehicle behaviors before real-world deployment (Wei et al., 2019) [1]. While high-fidelity 3D simulators like CARLA (Dosovitskiy et al., 2017)[2] offer detailed physics- based simulations, simplified 2D environments can provide rapid prototyping capabilities for testing basic traffic management algorithms and vehicle coordination strategies.
This study focuses on developing a lightweight simulation framework that captures essential aspects of autonomous vehicle behavior at traffic intersec<ons, including:
- Traffic light synchronization
- Vehicle spawning and path planning -
- Basic collision avoidance
- Multi-vehicle coordination
  
 Methods and Techniques
1. Game Loop Architecture
The simulation employs a standard game loop pattern with three primary components:
- Event handling for user input and system events
- State updates for all simulation objects
- Frame rendering at 30 FPS for smooth visualization
2. State Management System
The simulation maintains global state through structured dictionaries:
- Traffic light states and positions
- Vehicle positions and directions
- Infrastructure elements (sidewalks, dividers)
3. Modular Component Design
The system is divided into four primary modules:
- Environment rendering
- Traffic light control
- Vehicle spawning
- Vehicle movement and coordination
4. Traffic Management System
Implements a cyclic traffic light system with:
- Four-way intersec<on control
- Timer-based light changes
- Stop line enforcement
5. Probabilis:c Vehicle Generation
Employs a stochastic spawning system with:
- 2% spawn chance per frame per lane
- Initial velocity assignment
